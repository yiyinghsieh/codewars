"""Easy Line

In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, lines are 
numbered from zero (top).

[     [1],
     [1, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1],
 ...
]

We want to calculate the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients 
on a given line with a function called easyline (or easyLine or easy-line).
Can you write a program which calculate easyline(n) where n is the line 
number?
The function will take n (with: n>= 0) as parameter and will return the 
sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on line n.

##Examples:
easyline(0) => 1
easyline(1) => 2
easyline(4) => 70
easyline(50) => 100891344545564193334812497256

Note:
In Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, PHP, C, R, Nim, Fortran to 
get around the fact that we have no big integers the function easyLine(n) 
will in fact return

round(log(easyline(n)))
and not the easyline(n) of the other languages.
So, in Javascript, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, PHP, R, Nim, C, Fortran:

easyLine(0) => 0
easyLine(1) => 1
easyLine(4) => 4
easyLine(50) => 67
